As a user
I want to know if there are an equal number of 'x's and 'o's in a string
So that I can know if a game of tic tac to ended in a draw?

✅
GIVEN a non 'x' or 'o' character
WHEN the check is run
THEN the result should be true

✅
GIVEN a single 'x' or 'o'
WHEN the check is run
THEN the result should be false

✅
GIVEN a string with multiple 'x' and 'o', but the same amount
AND the cases of the characters can be upper or lower case
WHEN the check is run
THEN the result should be true
